Source code for the website http://playhubert.no/

This is a webpage I made to show off the Reinforcement Learning agent created for a project in a course at UiB. The webpage allows the user to upload custom made maps, or load in already made maps, and watch the agent attempt to solve them

Note that while the webpage is still being hosted, the server that hosts the maps and neural network (which controls the agent) is no longer running, and thus the webpage is not working as intended.
